# CO2-Emissions-in-Canada

In this model we predict the CO2 Emissions in Canada by the vehicles.

Firstly we predict the emission as per the Engine size by two different algorithms :Linear Regression by Gradient Descent and Normal equation 

Then we make the model for multiple variables, we predicted the emission on the parameters 'Engine Size(L)', 'Cylinders','Fuel Consumption Comb (mpg)'.
